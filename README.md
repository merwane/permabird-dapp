Permabird: Store and search tweets about a given subject on Arweave's Blockchain
==============================================

**Permabird-dapp** is a search interface for tweets permanently stored with [Permabird](https://github.com/merwane/permabird)

## It is constantly available [here](https://arweave.net/mbLTStjp0H-MaOIfSX3h5ouTGeMKldboFX2qf5MIrQE).


## Project setup

I decided to build the project from scratch rather than using a template. My dapp uses [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and of course, [arweave-js](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave-js).

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production and deployment on Arweave's permaweb
```
npm run build
```
