Grimoire: A Decentralized Academic Publishing Portal for the 21st century
==============================================

**Grimoire** is a decentralized platform built on top of [Arweave](http://arweave.org/)'s blockchain technology where you can publish and have free, perpetual access to academic research papers in a manner that has never been possible before.

I built it as a part of a hackathon but then I felt in love with the tech and I decided to maintain it and make more projects with Arweave's tech which I find insanely cool.

## It is constantly available [here](https://arweave.net/_SUE6NfJDaORXpNNGQH7KJGVFUuEdTiNS-TegIvCNLc).


## Project setup

I decided to build the project from scratch rather than using a template. My dapp uses [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and of course, [arweave-js](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave-js).

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production and deployment on Arweave's permaweb
```
npm run build
```
